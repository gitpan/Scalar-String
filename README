NAME

Scalar::String - string aspects of scalars

DESCRIPTION

This module is about the string part of plain Perl scalars.  A scalar has
a string value, which is notionally a sequence of Unicode codepoints, but
may be internally encoded in either ISO-8859-1 or UTF-8.  In places, and
more so in older versions of Perl, the internal encoding shows through.
To fully understand Perl strings it is necessary to understand these
implementation details.

This module provides functions to classify a string by encoding and to
encode a string in a desired way.

This module is implemented in XS, with a pure Perl backup version for
systems that can't handle XS.
